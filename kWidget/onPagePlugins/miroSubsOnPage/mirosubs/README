To run the development version:

1. Install virtualenv http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv
2. (optional) download and download the virtualenv wrapper bash
  functions http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper/
3. create a virtual environment and activate it
4. run:
   $ easy_install -U setuptools
   $ easy_install pip
   $ cd deploy
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
       note: you'll need mercurial installed to make this last command work.
5. Check out google closure into directory of your choice: svn checkout
   http://closure-library.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ <directory>. Then
   symlink media/js/closure-library to the checkout location.
6. Add mirosubs.example.com to your hosts file, pointing at 127.0.0.1.
   This is necessary for Twitter oauth to work correctly.
7. Use the dev-settings file when running manage.py. First run syncdb with
   --settings=dev-settings, then run migrate with --settings=dev-settings.
   Use ./dev-runserver.sh to run the development server with development
   settings. You can access the site at http://mirosubs.example.com:8000.
8. (optional) If you want to run video searches locally, you need to set up solr:
   A. Download solr and unzip to ../buildout/parts/solr (relative to this directory).
   B. Run ./manage.py run_solr in one terminal that is dedicated to running the solr process.
   C. run ./manage.py rebuild_index to update the index.
   D. That should be it but, in case you're interested, there's a
      list of haystack commands at
      http://docs.haystacksearch.org/dev/management_commands.html
