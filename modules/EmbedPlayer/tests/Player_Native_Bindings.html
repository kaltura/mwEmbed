    { event: 'emptied',     logMessage: "A media element whose networkState was previously not in the NETWORK_EMPTY state has just switched to that state (either because of a fatal error during load that's about to be reported, or because the load() method was invoked while the resource selection algorithm was already running)." },
    { event: 'stalled',     logMessage: 'The user agent is trying to fetch media data, but data is unexpectedly not forthcoming.' },

    { event: 'playing',         logMessage: 'Playback has started.' },
    { event: 'canplay',         logMessage: 'The user agent can resume playback of the media data, but estimates that if playback were to be started now, the media resource could not be rendered at the current playback rate up to its end without having to stop for further buffering of content.' },
    { event: 'canplaythrough',  logMessage: 'The user agent estimates that if playback were to be started now, the media resource could be rendered at the current playback rate all the way to its end without having to stop for further buffering.' },
