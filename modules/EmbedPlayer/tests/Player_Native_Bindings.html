    { event: 'abort',       logMessage: 'The user agent stops fetching the media data before it is completely downloaded, but not due to an error.' },
    { event: 'error',       logMessage: 'An error occurs while fetching the media data.' },
    { event: 'emptied',     logMessage: "A media element whose networkState was previously not in the NETWORK_EMPTY state has just switched to that state (either because of a fatal error during load that's about to be reported, or because the load() method was invoked while the resource selection algorithm was already running)." },
    { event: 'stalled',     logMessage: 'The user agent is trying to fetch media data, but data is unexpectedly not forthcoming.' },
    { event: 'play',        logMessage: 'Playback has begun. Fired after the play() method has returned, or when the autoplay attribute has caused playback to begin.' },
    { event: 'pause',       logMessage: 'Playback has been paused. Fired after the pause() method has returned.' },

    { event: 'waiting',         logMessage: 'Playback has stopped because the next frame is not available, but the user agent expects that frame to become available in due course.' },
    { event: 'playing',         logMessage: 'Playback has started.' },
    { event: 'canplay',         logMessage: 'The user agent can resume playback of the media data, but estimates that if playback were to be started now, the media resource could not be rendered at the current playback rate up to its end without having to stop for further buffering of content.' },
    { event: 'canplaythrough',  logMessage: 'The user agent estimates that if playback were to be started now, the media resource could be rendered at the current playback rate all the way to its end without having to stop for further buffering.' },
    { event: 'seeking',         logMessage: 'The seeking IDL attribute changed to true and the seek operation is taking long enough that the user agent has time to fire the event.' },
    { event: 'seeked',          logMessage: 'The seeking IDL attribute changed to false.' },

    { event: 'ended',           logMessage: 'Playback has stopped because the end of the media resource was reached.' },
