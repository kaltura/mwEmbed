# Contributing to iScroll / FAQ

## Why we need a CLA (Contributor License Agreement)

All contributions are welcome but to enforce the openness of this script I have to ask all contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement. I'm sorry about this but it's the only way to keep the script free and Open Source.

If you are an individual, please sign the following form:

If you are a company or an entity please sign the following form:

## Why is my patch not accepted yet?
Thank you very much for your contribution. Please make sure you signed the CLA (see above). Please note that pull requests may take some time to be accepted. Testing iScroll is one of the most time consuming tasks of the project. iScroll works from desktop to smartphone, from tablets to smart TVs. I do not have physical access to all the testing devices, so before I can push a change I have to make sure that the new code is working everywhere.

If you want to speed up the process, please provide your own test results and try to be as more specific as possible.

Thanks!
Matteo Spinelli
